- PoissonRegressor tricky to "tune" to get same results as statsmodels and R.
- How to do stratified cross-validation if stratification is not to be done on the response?
- D2 is the default scorer of GammaRegressor. What is its name? "r2"?
I would like to track D2 and "neg_mean_gamma_deviance" together in cross-validation.

- Wish 1: Option to relax y scale
- Wish 2: variable_splits -> specify only subset

Made two issues on dalex github page.
