- PoissonRegressor tricky to "tune" to get same results as statsmodels and R.
- How to do stratified cross-validation for non-discrete responses? -> Unclear
- D2 is the default scorer of GammaRegressor. What is its name? "r2"?
I would like to track D2 and "neg_mean_gamma_deviance" together in cross-validation.

model_profile
- Wish 1: Option to relax y scale -> implemented
- Wish 2: variable_splits -> specify only subset

Made two issues on dalex github page.
